Okay, so I need to categorize each column in this dataset into numerical (continuous or discrete), categorical (ordinal or nominal), or temporal. Let me go through each column one by one.

Starting with 'student_id'. It's an object type, so it's probably strings like S1000, S1001, etc. Since it's just an identifier, it's nominal categorical because it doesn't have any inherent order.

Next is 'age'. That's an integer, so numerical. It's discrete because age is counted in whole numbers.

'gender' is object type, so it's either male or female. That's nominal categorical as well.

'study_hours_per_day' is a float. It's numerical and continuous because it can take any value within a range, even though it's in hours, it's measured in fractions.

'social_media_hours' and 'netflix_hours' are similar, both floats, so numerical and continuous.

'part_time_job' is object, with values like Yes or No. That's nominal categorical.

'attendance_percentage' is a float, so numerical and continuous, as it can range from 0 to 100 in any fraction.

'sleep_hours' is a float, so numerical and continuous.

'diet_quality' is object. The preview shows values like Fair, Good, Poor. That's ordinal because there's a hierarchy: Poor < Fair < Good.

'exercise_frequency' is an integer. It ranges from 0 to 6, so it's numerical and discrete.

'parental_education_level' is object with values like Master, High School, etc. That's nominal because the education levels don't have a clear order without more context.

'internet_quality' is object with values like Average, Good, Poor. That's ordinal because there's a clear ranking from Poor to Good.

'mental_health_rating' is an integer from 1 to 10. That's ordinal because it's a rating scale.

'extracurricular_participation' is object with Yes/No, so nominal categorical.

'exam_score' is a float, so numerical and continuous.

I don't see any temporal columns here, so none of them fall into that category.

Alright, I need to categorize each column in the dataset into numerical (continuous/discrete), categorical (ordinal/nominal), or temporal. Let me go through each column one by one.

Starting with 'student_id'. It's an object type, which usually means strings. Since each student has a unique ID, it's a nominal category because it doesn't have any inherent order.

Next, 'age' is an integer. It's a count of years, so it's numerical and discrete because you can't have a fraction of a year in this context.

'gender' is another object type. It's typically male or female, so it's nominal categorical.

'study_hours_per_day' is a float. It represents a continuous measure of time spent studying, so it's numerical and continuous.

'social_media_hours' and 'netflix_hours' are also floats, similar to study hours. They measure time spent, so they're numerical and continuous.

'part_time_job' is an object with values like 'Yes' or 'No'. This is a binary category, so it's nominal.

'attendance_percentage' is a float, but it's a percentage which is a continuous measure. So, numerical and continuous.

'sleep_hours' is a float, measuring time, so numerical and continuous.

'diet_quality' is an object with categories like 'Poor', 'Fair', 'Good'. This seems like an ordinal category because there's an order from poor to good.

'exercise_frequency' is an integer, but looking at the data, it's more about categories (like how often someone exercises) rather than a count. So, it's ordinal categorical.

'parental_education_level' is an object with categories like 'Master', 'High School', etc. This is ordinal because higher levels of education are better or more advanced.

'internet_quality' is an object with categories like 'Poor', 'Average', 'Good'. Again, ordinal because there's a clear order.

'mental_health_rating' is an integer, but it's a rating scale, so it's ordinal.

'extracurricular_participation' is an object, likely 'Yes' or 'No', making it nominal.

'exam_score' is a float, representing a continuous score, so numerical and continuous.

I don't see any temporal columns here, so none are categorized as temporal.
