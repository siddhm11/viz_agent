Okay, so I need to categorize each column in this dataset into one of the specified categories. Let me go through each column one by one, considering the data type, sample values, and the column name to determine the most appropriate category.

Starting with 'student_id'. The dtype is object, and the sample values are like 'S1000', 'S1001', etc. These look like unique identifiers for each student. Since they are not numerical and don't represent any particular order or category, I think this should be 'categorical_nominal'.

Next is 'age'. The dtype is int64, and the values are numbers like 23, 20, 21. Age is a count of years, so it's a numerical value. Since it's an integer, it might be considered 'numerical_discrete', but age can technically be any integer, so it could also be seen as continuous. However, in this context, since it's measured in whole numbers, I'll go with 'numerical_discrete'.

'gender' is an object dtype with values like 'Female' and 'Male'. This is clearly a category without any inherent order, so it's 'categorical_nominal'.

'study_hours_per_day' is a float. The values have decimal points, like 0.0, 6.9, etc. This represents a measurement, so it should be 'numerical_continuous'.

'social_media_hours' and 'netflix_hours' are also floats with decimal values. They measure time spent, so both should be 'numerical_continuous'.

'part_time_job' is an object with values 'Yes' and 'No'. This is a binary value, so it fits into the 'boolean' category.

'attendance_percentage' is a float, but it's a percentage, which is a ratio. So, it's 'numerical_continuous'.

'sleep_hours' is a float, representing hours slept, so it's a measurement and thus 'numerical_continuous'.

'diet_quality' is an object with values like 'Fair', 'Good', 'Poor'. These are categories without a specific order, so it's 'categorical_nominal'.

'exercise_frequency' is an integer, but looking at the sample values, it seems to represent how often someone exercises, like 6, 1, 3. This could be considered 'numerical_discrete' since it's a count, but it might also represent an ordinal scale if the numbers correspond to categories like 'Never', 'Sometimes', etc. However, without explicit labels, it's safer to treat it as 'numerical_discrete'.

'parental_education_level' is an object with values like 'Master', 'High School', etc. These are categories without a specific order, so it's 'categorical_nominal'.

'internet_quality' is an object with values like 'Average', 'Poor', 'Good'. These are categories without a specific order, so 'categorical_nominal'.

'mental_health_rating' is an integer with values like 8, 1, 10. This seems like a rating scale, which implies an order. So, it should be 'categorical_ordinal'.

'extracurricular_participation' is an object with 'Yes' and 'No', which is a binary value, so 'boolean'.

Finally, 'exam_score' is a float, representing a score which is a measurement, so it's 'numerical_continuous'.
