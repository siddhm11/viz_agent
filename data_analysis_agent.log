Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to categorize each column in the dataset into numerical (continuous or discrete), categorical (ordinal or nominal), or temporal. 

First, I'll go through each column one by one. Let's start with the columns listed in the data preview and the data information provided.

Starting with 'student_id': It's an object type, which suggests it's a string. Since student IDs are usually unique identifiers without any inherent order or quantitative value, this should be categorical. But since it's an identifier, maybe it's nominal. So, categorical nominal.

Next, 'age' is an int64. Age is typically a continuous variable, but since it's recorded as an integer (like 20, 21), it's discrete. So numerical discrete.

'gender' is an object, which is likely a string like 'Male' or 'Female'. That's a categorical nominal variable because there's no order.

'study_hours_per_day' is a float. Hours can take decimal values, so that's continuous numerical.

'social_media_hours' and 'netflix_hours' are also floats, so same as above—continuous numerical.

'part_time_job' is an object, probably 'Yes' or 'No', so categorical nominal.

'attendance_percentage' is a float. Percentages can be decimals, so continuous numerical.

'sleep_hours' is float, so continuous numerical.

'diet_quality' is an object. The data preview shows entries like 'Fair', 'Good', 'Poor'. These might be ordinal since they can be ordered (Poor < Fair < Good). But sometimes people treat them as nominal if the order isn't strictly defined. Hmm, but the question says to categorize, so I'll go with ordinal here.

'exercise_frequency' is an integer. The data info says it's int64. The example data shows values like 6, 1, 4, etc. But exercise frequency could be a count (like days per week), which is discrete numerical. Wait, but maybe it's a scale from 1 to 6? The problem is, without more context, but since it's an integer, I think it's numerical discrete. Wait, but if it's a Likert scale (e.g., 1=never, 6=every day), then it's ordinal categorical. Hmm, tricky. The data type is int64, but the values might represent categories. The question says to categorize based on the data types and the column's nature. Since the column is called 'exercise_frequency', maybe it's a count (like number of days per week), which would be discrete numerical. Alternatively, if it's a rating, then ordinal. The data preview shows for row 2, exercise_frequency is 1, which might mean low frequency. Since the user provided the data types, and the column is int64, but the values could be ordinal. Wait, the basic statistics show min 0, max 6. Maybe it's a scale from 0 to 6 where higher is better. So that's ordinal categorical. Hmm, need to decide. The problem says to categorize based on the data types and the column's name. Since it's an integer but represents a frequency (like days per week), it's a count, so numerical discrete. Alternatively, if it's a self-reported frequency on a scale, then ordinal. The problem might expect ordinal here. Let me check the data preview again. In row 2, exercise_frequency is 1, and in row 3 it's 4. Maybe it's a scale from 1 to 6 where 1 is low and 6 is high. So ordinal categorical. But the data type is int64. The user's instruction says to categorize based on the column's data type and their nature. Since the values are integers but represent ordered categories, it's ordinal. So I'll categorize it as categorical ordinal.

'parental_education_level' is an object, so likely categories like 'High School', 'Master', etc. These are nominal unless there's an order, but education levels can be ordered (e.g., High School < Bachelor < Master). But since the data has entries like 'Master', 'High School', maybe they are nominal unless specified. The problem might consider them as nominal unless explicitly ordinal. So categorical nominal.

'internet_quality' is an object, probably like 'Poor', 'Average', 'Good'—so ordinal? Or nominal? If the categories have an order, then ordinal. But without knowing the exact categories, maybe safer to assume nominal unless specified. The data preview shows 'Average', 'Poor', 'Good', so they might be ordinal. Hmm, but the user might expect ordinal here. Let me think. Since the name is 'quality', which can be ordered, so ordinal.

'mental_health_rating' is an integer. The basic stats show min 1, max 10. It's likely a rating scale from 1 to 10, which is ordinal. So categorical ordinal? Wait, but sometimes ratings can be treated as interval if they're considered numerical. But since it's an integer and the name is 'rating', it's probably ordinal. Wait, the data type is int64, but if it's a score from 1-10, it's numerical continuous? Or discrete? Wait, integers can be discrete numerical. But a mental health rating on a scale is often treated as ordinal. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The problem says to categorize based on data types and their nature. Since it's an integer but represents a rating (like 1 to 10), it's ordinal categorical. Wait, but sometimes people treat such scales as numerical. The question might expect it to be numerical continuous if it's a score. Wait, the basic statistics for mental_health_rating has a mean of 5.438, which is a numerical value. But the data type is int64. Since it's a rating from 1-10, it's an ordinal categorical variable. Because even though it's numeric, the values represent categories with order. So I'll go with categorical ordinal.

Wait, but sometimes people treat such Likert scales as numerical. Hmm, maybe the user expects it as numerical? The problem says to categorize each as numerical (continuous/discrete) or categorical (ordinal/nominal) or temporal. Since it's an integer, but the values are categories (like 1 to 10 as levels), it's ordinal. So categorical ordinal.

'extracurricular_participation' is an object, probably 'Yes'/'No' or similar, so categorical nominal.

'exam_score' is a float, so continuous numerical.

Now, let's go through each column again systematically:

- student_id: object, nominal categorical (identifier)
- age: int64, discrete numerical (since age is counted in whole years)
- gender: object, nominal categorical
- study_hours_per_day: float, continuous numerical
- social_media_hours: same as above, continuous
- netflix_hours: same, continuous
- part_time_job: object (Yes/No), nominal
- attendance_percentage: float (could be a percentage like 85.0, which can have decimals, so continuous)
- sleep_hours: float, continuous
- diet_quality: object (Fair, Good, Poor), ordinal categorical (since there's an order)
- exercise_frequency: int64. Earlier thought: if it's a scale (like 1-6 where higher is more frequent), then ordinal categorical. But the data type is int64. The problem says to categorize based on data types and their nature. Since it's an integer but represents ordered categories (like 1=never to 6=every day), it's ordinal categorical. But if it's a count (e.g., number of days per week), then it's discrete numerical. The name is 'frequency', which could be a count (discrete numerical) or a category. Looking at the data preview, row 2 has 1, row 0 has 6, row 3 has 4. Maybe it's a scale from 1 to 6, so ordinal. So categorical ordinal.

Wait, the data's basic statistics for exercise_frequency has min 0, max 6, so maybe it's a scale from 0 to 6 where each number represents a level. So ordinal categorical.

parental_education_level: object, categories like 'High School', 'Master', etc. These can be ordered (e.g., High School < Bachelor < Master), so ordinal? Or nominal? Since education levels can be ordered, it's ordinal. So categorical ordinal.

internet_quality: object, like 'Poor', 'Average', 'Good'—ordinal.

mental_health_rating: int64, 1-10, ordinal categorical.

extracurricular_participation: object (Yes/No?), but looking at the data, in row 0 it's 'Yes', row1 'No', etc. So that's nominal (binary, but still nominal).

exam_score: float, continuous numerical.

Wait, let me confirm each:

student_id: categorical nominal.

age: numerical discrete (since age is counted in whole numbers, even though it's a count, but age can be a continuous variable in reality, but here it's stored as int, so discrete numerical? Or is age considered continuous? Age in years is discrete because it's counted in whole numbers, but sometimes treated as continuous. The problem says to categorize as numerical (continuous/discrete). Since it's in whole numbers, but can take any integer value within a range, it's discrete numerical.

gender: categorical nominal.

study_hours_per_day: continuous numerical (float).

social_media_hours: same.

netflix_hours: same.

part_time_job: categorical nominal (Yes/No).

attendance_percentage: continuous (since it's a percentage with decimals).

sleep_hours: continuous.

diet_quality: ordinal categorical (Poor < Fair < Good).

exercise_frequency: categorical ordinal (assuming 1 to 6 with order).

parental_education_level: ordinal categorical (like levels of education).

internet_quality: ordinal (Poor, Average, Good).

mental_health_rating: ordinal categorical (1-10 scale).

extracurricular_participation: categorical nominal (Yes/No).

exam_score: continuous numerical.

Wait, 'extracurricular_participation' in the data preview has entries like 'Yes' and 'No', so that's a binary categorical, which is nominal.

Putting it all together:

Let me list each column:

1. student_id: categorical, nominal
2. age: numerical, discrete
3. gender: categorical, nominal
4. study_hours_per_day: numerical, continuous
5. social_media_hours: numerical, continuous
6. netflix_hours: numerical, continuous
7. part_time_job: categorical, nominal
8. attendance_percentage: numerical, continuous (since it's a percentage with decimals)
9. sleep_hours: numerical, continuous
10. diet_quality: categorical, ordinal
11. exercise_frequency: categorical, ordinal (assuming it's a scale)
12. parental_education_level: categorical, ordinal (since levels can be ordered)
13. internet_quality: categorical, ordinal
14. mental_health_rating: categorical, ordinal (1-10)
15. extracurricular_participation: categorical, nominal (Yes/No)
16. exam_score: numerical, continuous

Wait, but for exercise_frequency, the data type is int64. The problem says to categorize based on data types and their nature. If exercise_frequency is an integer count (e.g., number of days per week), then it's numerical discrete. But if it's a scale (like 1=never to 6=every day), then it's ordinal. The name is 'frequency', which could be a count (discrete numerical) or a category. Looking at the data preview, row 2 has 1, row 0 has 6, row3 has 4. Maybe it's a scale from 1 to 6 where higher is more frequent. So ordinal categorical. So I'll go with ordinal.

Parental_education_level: The entries in the data are 'Master', 'High School', etc. These can be ordered (e.g., High School < Bachelor < Master's). So ordinal.

Internet_quality: entries like 'Poor', 'Average', 'Good'—ordinal.

Mental_health_rating: integer from 1-10, ordinal.

So the final categorization would be:

student_id: categorical nominal

age: numerical discrete

gender: categorical nominal

study_hours_per_day: numerical continuous

social_media_hours: numerical continuous

netflix_hours: numerical continuous

part_time_job: categorical nominal

attendance_percentage: numerical continuous (since it's a percentage with decimals)

sleep_hours: numerical continuous

diet_quality: categorical ordinal

exercise_frequency: categorical ordinal

parental_education_level: categorical ordinal

internet_quality: categorical ordinal

mental_health_rating: categorical ordinal (since it's a rating scale)

extracurricular_participation: categorical nominal (Yes/No)

exam_score: numerical continuous

Wait, but mental_health_rating is an integer. The data type is int64, but the values are 1-10, which is an ordinal scale. So it's categorical ordinal. Alternatively, sometimes treated as numerical, but since it's a rating, it's ordinal. The problem says to categorize based on their nature. So ordinal.

Putting all into the dictionary:

The keys are the column names, and the values are the categories.

Wait, let me list all columns again:

Columns: ['student_id', 'age', 'gender', 'study_hours_per_day', 'social_media_hours', 'netflix_hours', 'part_time_job', 'attendance_percentage', 'sleep_hours', 'diet_quality', 'exercise_frequency', 'parental_education_level', 'internet_quality', 'mental_health_rating', 'extracurricular_participation', 'exam_score']

Now, for each:

student_id: categorical, nominal

age: numerical, discrete

gender: categorical, nominal

study_hours_per_day: numerical, continuous

social_media_hours: same as above, continuous

netflix_hours: same

part_time_job: categorical, nominal (Yes/No)

attendance_percentage: numerical, continuous (since it's a percentage with decimals)

sleep_hours: numerical, continuous

diet_quality: categorical, ordinal

exercise_frequency: categorical, ordinal (assuming it's a scale)

parental_education_level: categorical, ordinal (since levels can be ordered)

internet_quality: categorical, ordinal

mental_health_rating: categorical, ordinal (1-10)

extracurricular_participation: categorical, nominal (Yes/No)

exam_score: numerical, continuous

Wait, but 'exam_score' is a score, which is numerical continuous.

So the final dictionary entries would be:

{
    'student_id': 'categorical (nominal)',
    'age': 'numerical (discrete)',
    'gender': 'categorical (nominal)',
    'study_hours_per_day': 'numerical (continuous)',
    'social_media_hours': 'numerical (continuous)',
    'netflix_hours': 'numerical (continuous)',
    'part_time_job': 'categorical (nominal)',
    'attendance_percentage': 'numerical (continuous)',
    'sleep_hours': 'numerical (continuous)',
    'diet_quality': 'categorical (ordinal)',
    'exercise_frequency': 'categorical (ordinal)',
    'parental_education_level': 'categorical (ordinal)',
    'internet_quality': 'categorical (ordinal)',
    'mental_health_rating': 'categorical (ordinal)',
    'extracurricular_participation': 'categorical (nominal)',
    'exam_score': 'numerical (continuous)'
}

Wait, but 'mental_health_rating' is an integer. The data type is int64, but the values are 1-10, which is ordinal. So yes, categorical ordinal.

Wait, but sometimes mental health ratings can be treated as numerical, but since it's a rating scale, it's ordinal. The problem says to categorize based on their nature. So ordinal.

Similarly, 'exercise_frequency' is int64 but represents an ordinal scale, so categorical ordinal.

Parental_education_level is categories like 'High School', 'Master', etc. These can be ordered, so ordinal.

Internet_quality: ordinal.

Now, check each:

- 'exercise_frequency' is int64. The data's basic stats show min 0, max 6. The data preview shows entries like 6, 1, 4, 3. Maybe 0 is a category (e.g., 0 = never, 1= rarely, ..., 6= daily). So ordinal. So categorical ordinal.

Yes, so that's correct.

Now, let me make sure all are covered:

- 'part_time_job' is 'Yes'/'No' → nominal.

- 'diet_quality' is Fair, Poor, Good → ordinal.

- 'parental_education_level' is categories like High School, Master, etc. → ordinal.

- 'internet_quality' like Poor, Average, Good → ordinal.

- 'mental_health_rating' 1-10 → ordinal.

- 'extracurricular_participation' is Yes/No → nominal.

Alright, that seems consistent.

Now, the keys must be the column names exactly as given. Also, check for typos in column names. The user provided the columns as:

Columns: ['student_id', 'age', 'gender', 'study_hours_per_day', 'social_media_hours', 'netflix_hours', 'part_time_job', 'attendance_percentage', 'sleep_hours', 'diet_quality', 'exercise_frequency', 'parental_education_level', 'internet_quality', 'mental_health_rating', 'extracurricular_participation', 'exam_score']

Wait, the last one is 'extracurricular_participation' (maybe a typo in the column name? The data preview shows 'extracurricular_participation' with a typo (participation instead of participation). But the user provided the column name as written, so must use exactly as given.

Now, compiling the dictionary:

Each entry is the column name as key, and the value is the category and type.

So the final dictionary entries:

Okay, so I need to categorize each column in the given dataset into numerical (continuous or discrete), categorical (ordinal or nominal), or temporal. Let me go through each column one by one and think about their data types and what they represent.

Starting with 'student_id'. It's an object type, which usually means strings. Student IDs are typically unique identifiers, so they don't have any inherent order or category. That makes them nominal categorical.

Next is 'age'. It's an integer, so that's numerical. Since age can take on a range of values without any categories, it's continuous.

'Gender' is an object, so it's a string. It represents categories like Male, Female, etc., which are nominal since there's no inherent order.

'study_hours_per_day' is a float. It's a continuous numerical variable because it can take any value within a range, like 0.0, 1.4, etc.

'social_media_hours' and 'netflix_hours' are also floats, so similar to study hours, they are continuous numerical.

'part_time_job' is an object, likely with values like 'Yes' or 'No'. That's a nominal categorical variable.

'attendance_percentage' is a float, ranging from 0 to 100. It's continuous numerical.

'sleep_hours' is a float as well, so continuous numerical.

'diet_quality' is an object. The preview shows values like 'Fair', 'Good', 'Poor', which are categories without a specific order, making it nominal.

'exercise_frequency' is an integer, but looking at the data, it seems to represent categories like how often someone exercises (e.g., 0 to 6 times). However, since it's an integer, it might be considered ordinal if the numbers represent an order, like 0 being none and 6 being highest. But sometimes, such variables are treated as categorical if they represent distinct groups. I'm a bit unsure here, but I think it's safer to categorize it as ordinal since the numbers imply a progression.

'parental_education_level' is an object with values like 'Master', 'High School'. These are categories without a specific order, so nominal.

'internet_quality' is an object with values like 'Average', 'Poor', 'Good'—again, nominal categories.

'mental_health_rating' is an integer, but the values range from 1 to 10, which suggests it's a rating scale. This is ordinal because each number represents a higher level of mental health.

'extracurricular_participation' is an object, likely 'Yes' or 'No', so nominal.

'exam_score' is a float, which is continuous numerical.

I don't see any temporal columns here, as none of the columns represent dates or times. So, all columns are either numerical or categorical.

Wait, 'exercise_frequency' is an integer, but in the data preview, it's shown as 6, 1, 4, etc. It might actually be a categorical variable where each number represents a category, like how many times a week someone exercises. But since it's an integer, it's more likely to be treated as numerical discrete. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider. If it's about frequency, like 0 days a week, 1 day, etc., up to 6, then it's discrete numerical. But if it's an ordinal scale, like 1 being 'Never' and 6 being 'Every day', then it's ordinal categorical. Looking back at the data preview, the values are 6, 6, 1, 4, 3. These could be representing the number of days per week, making it discrete numerical. So maybe I should classify 'exercise_frequency' as numerical discrete instead of categorical.

Similarly, 'mental_health_rating' is an integer from 1 to 10, which is more like a continuous scale, but since it's bounded and in integers, it's discrete numerical. Wait, but earlier I thought it was ordinal. Maybe it's better to categorize it as numerical discrete because it's a rating on a scale, which is a form of continuous measure but in discrete steps.

Wait, no, mental health rating is likely ordinal because each step represents a higher level of mental health, even if it's on a scale. So maybe it's better to keep it as ordinal categorical.

I think I need to adjust some of these. Let me go through each again:

- 'student_id': nominal categorical
- 'age': numerical continuous
- 'gender': nominal categorical
- 'study_hours_per_day': numerical continuous
- 'social_media_hours': numerical continuous
- 'netflix_hours': numerical continuous
- 'part_time_job': nominal categorical
- 'attendance_percentage': numerical continuous
- 'sleep_hours': numerical continuous
- 'diet_quality': nominal categorical
- 'exercise_frequency': ordinal categorical (since it's about frequency levels)
- 'parental_education_level': nominal categorical
- 'internet_quality': nominal categorical
- 'mental_health_rating': ordinal categorical (as it's a rating scale)
- 'extracurricular_participation': nominal categorical
- 'exam_score': numerical continuous

Wait, but 'exercise_frequency' is an integer, so maybe it's numerical discrete. Similarly, 'mental_health_rating' is an integer, so perhaps numerical discrete. But in the context, they might be treated as ordinal categories. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps 'exercise_frequency' is numerical discrete because it counts the number of times someone exercises per week, which is a discrete numerical variable. Similarly, 'mental_health_rating' is a discrete numerical variable because it's a score on a scale, even though it's ordinal in nature.

I think the key is whether the variable is measured on a scale that has inherent order. For 'exercise_frequency', if it's the number of days per week, it's numerical discrete. If it's a category like 'Never', 'Sometimes', 'Often', then it's ordinal. Since the data shows integers, I think it's the former—number of days, so numerical discrete.

Similarly, 'mental_health_rating' is a score from 1 to 10, which is a discrete numerical variable, even though it's ordinal in the sense that higher is better.

So, adjusting:

- 'exercise_frequency': numerical discrete
- 'mental_health_rating': numerical discrete

But wait, in the data preview, 'exercise_frequency' has values like 6, 1, 4, 3. That seems like it's the number of times per week, so numerical discrete.

Similarly, 'mental_health_rating' is 8, 8, 1, 1, 1—so it's a score, which is numerical discrete.

So, I think I should categorize them as numerical discrete.

So, final categorization:

- numerical continuous: age, study_hours_per_day, social_media_hours, netflix_hours, attendance_percentage, sleep_hours, exam_score
- numerical discrete: exercise_frequency, mental_health_rating
- categorical nominal: student_id, gender, part_time_job, diet_quality, parental_education_level, internet_quality, extracurricular_participation
- categorical ordinal: none, since exercise_frequency and mental_health_rating are numerical discrete.

Wait, but 'diet_quality' has values like 'Fair', 'Good', 'Poor'—these are ordered categories, so maybe that's ordinal. Similarly, 'internet_quality' has 'Average', 'Poor', 'Good'—also ordered. So perhaps those should be ordinal categorical.

Similarly, 'parental_education_level' has 'Master', 'High School'—which is ordered, so that's ordinal.

So, adjusting again:

- 'diet_quality': ordinal categorical
- 'internet_quality': ordinal categorical
- 'parental_education_level': ordinal categorical

So, the final categorization would have some ordinal categories.

I think that's a more accurate approach.
